# lw3dge 
#### also known as `LW 3D GE` or `L-Wedge`
A Light Weight 3D Game Engine in Java, written using LWJGL 3.2.1 and custom physics and object management code.
This Game Engine focuses on high readability, light-weight implementation, and developer empowerment (developer = Library User).

## Project Goals
  - Easy to Implement
    - Open Source, all dependencies are also Open Source
    - Non-Restrictive License
  - Easy to Understand
    - I built this in a manner to make readability quite high.  (check documentation for examples)
  - Easy to Alter (high customability for the developer)
    - Developer gets the Entry Point
    - Developer gets control over when to enter game loop
    - Developer gets control over Models And Textures
      - You decide your own Model Framework, but there will be a suggested format in the Documentation
  - Lightweight To Simply provide a framework
      - This is essentially a giant wrapper on LWJGL, and Custom Game Engine code for your use!
